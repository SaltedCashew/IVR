Current status & instructions:

This program identifies captured images of playing cards through three main stages: segmentation of the symbols on the card, isolation of the individual symbols to extract features, and card recognition based on these features. 

Run: cardDriver('imagelocationstring');
Results display in both in command window and with 2 image figures. The command window displays the card identification. Figure 1 displays the original image with bounding boxes around the detected features. Figure 2 displays the binary image without bounding boxes.
